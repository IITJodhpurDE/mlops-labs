# 🚀 GitHub Actions Setup Instructions

## 📋 **Next Steps to Enable GitHub Actions**

### **Step 1: Create GitHub Repository**
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click **"New Repository"** (green button)
3. Repository name: `mlops-digit-classification`
4. Description: `MLOps lab with digit classification and GitHub Actions CI/CD`
5. ✅ **Public** (recommended for learning)
6. ❌ **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click **"Create repository"**

### **Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub**
```bash
# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mlops-digit-classification.git

# Or use SSH if you have SSH keys set up:
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/mlops-digit-classification.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### **Step 3: Verify GitHub Actions**
After pushing, GitHub Actions will automatically:
1. 🔍 Detect the `.github/workflows/github-actions-demo.yml` file
2. 🚀 Trigger the workflow on the first push
3. 📊 Show results in the **"Actions"** tab

### **Step 4: View Actions Results**
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **"Actions"** tab
3. See the **"GitHub Actions Demo"** workflow
4. Click on the latest run to see:
   - ✅ Setup steps
   - 📦 Dependency installation
   - 🧠 ML model training
   - 📊 Classification results

---

## 🔄 **Testing the Workflow**

### **Make a Test Change**
```bash
# Create a test branch
git checkout -b test-actions

# Make a small change (add a comment to the Python file)
echo "# Test comment for GitHub Actions" >> plot_digits_classification.py

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "test: trigger GitHub Actions workflow"
git push -u origin test-actions
```

### **Create Pull Request**
1. GitHub will show **"Compare & pull request"** button
2. Click it to create a PR
3. GitHub Actions will run automatically
4. See the results in the PR checks

## 📊 **Expected Workflow Output**

When GitHub Actions runs, you'll see output like:
```
✅ The job was automatically triggered by a push event
✅ This job is now running on a Linux server hosted by GitHub!
✅ Repository cloned successfully
📦 Installing dependencies from requirements.txt
🧠 Running digit classification experiment
✅ Workflow completed successfully
```

---

## 🛠️ **Alternative: Manual Setup Commands**

If you prefer to set up everything manually:

```bash
# Check current remote
git remote -v

# If no remote exists, add one:
git remote add origin <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>

# Push all branches
git push --all origin

# Set main as default branch
git push -u origin main
```

---

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

Your GitHub Actions setup is complete when:
- ✅ Repository is on GitHub
- ✅ Actions tab shows workflow runs
- ✅ Green checkmarks on commits
- ✅ Workflow logs show successful ML execution
- ✅ Pull requests trigger automatic testing

---

## 📚 **Next Learning Steps**

Once GitHub Actions is working:
1. 🔄 **Practice Git workflow**: Create branches, make changes, merge PRs
2. 📊 **Enhance the model**: Try different algorithms or parameters
3. 🧪 **Add more tests**: Create unit tests for the ML pipeline
4. 🚀 **Deploy the model**: Add deployment steps to the workflow
5. 📈 **Monitor performance**: Add logging and metrics collection

---

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**
- **Workflow not triggering**: Check `.github/workflows/` folder exists
- **Python errors**: Verify `requirements.txt` has all dependencies
- **Permission errors**: Ensure repository has Actions enabled in Settings

### **Debug Commands:**
```bash
# Check workflow file syntax
cat .github/workflows/github-actions-demo.yml

# Verify all files are committed
git status
git log --oneline

# Check remote connection
git remote -v
```

---

## 🏆 **Achievement Unlocked!**

When your workflow runs successfully, you'll have:
- ✅ **Complete MLOps pipeline** with automated testing
- ✅ **CI/CD best practices** implemented
- ✅ **Reproducible ML experiments** in the cloud
- ✅ **Professional development workflow** ready for real projects

🎉 **Congratulations on setting up your first MLOps pipeline with GitHub Actions!**
